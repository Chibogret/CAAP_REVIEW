Understood. I will generate a complete JSON-formatted 200-item Principles of Flight exam for the Private Pilot License (PPL) under CAAP standards, focused exclusively on fixed-wing aircraft. The questions will range from easy to difficult, and answer choices will be randomized to avoid pattern bias.

I'll start compiling the dataset and will share the JSON file with you once it's complete.
